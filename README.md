# Refund Automation with Typeform & Revolut

## About
This no-code automation streamlines the process of handling refund requests submitted by customers. By integrating Typeform, Google Sheets, Revolut Business, and email notifications through Make.com, it automatically creates draft refund payments and notifies a team member for approval—eliminating manual processing and reducing errors.
